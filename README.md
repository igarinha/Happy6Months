# 💖 Happy6Months 💖

Welcome to the *cutest* repo on GitHub. I made this to the *cutest* girl ever(Igarinha Gatinha bb). This is my way of showing you that I love you, it required quite some effort and I hope you like it  
This repo was created to celebrate our 6 months together, I doubt anyone would make something this cute to you (right?). 🌙✨

## 🥰 Why This Repo Exists

Well at first it is just a nerdy way to show you that I love you but now that I think about it is a cute way of saving our pics as some sort of diary. I hope you add to it.

a little Markdown tutorial:

use # and blank < > for writing a title ## < > for a subtitle and so on.
to add images use *<![Image Description](Image_path)>*
ALWAYS ADD THESE STUFF TO THE FILE README.md

## 🖼️ Our Love Story in Pictures

Each image is named `img{number}.jpg` – they are referenced so that you can quickly access them

## 💬 Little Notes (Click to jump to the memory!)

I honestly hope you cherish this repository, this is very nerdy (as I know you like) also this might be somewhat useful to you so you learn a little bit how to code, use git and run scripts in python 🐍
