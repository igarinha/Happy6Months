# 💖 Happy6Months 💖

Welcome to the *cutest* repo on GitHub. I made this to the *cutest* girl ever(Igarinha Gatinha bb). This is my way of showing you that I love you, it required quite some effort and I hope you like it  
This repo was created to celebrate our 6 months together, I doubt anyone would make something this cute to you (right?). 🌙✨

## 💻 How to Use This Lovely Script

You can decorate our photos with adorable hearts 💖 or tiny pinguimzinhos 🐧 – just like digital stickers!

### ▶️ To Start

Run the script:

```bash
python3 i_love_you.py
```

### 🎮 Controls

- Press `1` → Choose **💖 hearts** mode  
- Press `2` → Choose **🐧 pinguimzinhos** mode  
- 🖱️ Click on the image → Add the selected sticker (heart or pinguimzinho)  
- Press `s` → **Save** the image with all the decorations 💾  


## 🥰 Why This Repo Exists

Well at first it is just a nerdy way to show you that I love you but now that I think about it is a cute way of saving our pics as some sort of diary. I hope you add to it.

a little Markdown tutorial:

use # and blank < > for writing a title ## < > for a subtitle and so on.
to add images use *<![Image Description](Image_path)>*
ALWAYS ADD THESE STUFF TO THE FILE README.md

## 🖼️ Our Love Story in Pictures

Each image is named `img{number}.jpg` – they are referenced so that you can quickly access them
